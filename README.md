# ComparisionOperators-Pt.1
Some comparison operators exercise I did For Javascript course
So today, I learned about comparison operators, you use these to compare values. Some operators are: Less than: <, Greater than: >, Less than or equal to: <=, Greater than or equal to: >=, Is equal to: =, and Is not equal to: !==.  Comparison operators can also be used on different data types like strings. 

So, in these exercise, I played around with the condition by tweaking the comaprison of hungerLevel (variable) by using different operators such as: <=. ?=, >, and <. First up, I use <=.

Step 1: Using let, create variable named hungerLevel and set it to equal to 7.
Step 2: Write an if...else statement using a comparison operator. The condition should check if hungerLevel is greater than 7. If so, the conditional statement should log, 'Time to eat!' Otherwise, it should log 'We can eat later!'; After you run code, play around with condition by tweaking comparison of hungerLevel by using different operators.
